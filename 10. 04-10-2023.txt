Today i worked with the addProducts pages and pending e-commerce website ,


Then i added the checkout option , after all the products has been added to the user,
the order will be placed and then it will redirect to a order-page where he can see his orders details .

 
This order of the particular user will be shown to the admin to accept or cancel the order.
