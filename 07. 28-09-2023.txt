onload property : it is used to change or manipulate the page when it is loading.
for example:  onload=fn() the function fn() will be called when the page is starts loading.
we can use that function to manipulate or do something when the page is loading.

QuerySelector : This is used to get element value like the document.getElementById, but using this we can get element by class name instead. 
But it will have html collections and we have to access it by array.
